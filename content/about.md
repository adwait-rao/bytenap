I'm a third-year 🎓 Computer Science student based in Pune. I enjoy experimenting 🧪 with technology, building things 🛠️, and learning by doing.

Right now, I'm focused on:

- ⚙️ Go for backend development  
- 📱 TypeScript and React Native for mobile apps  
- 🌐 Distributed systems and how large-scale software works behind the scenes  

This site is where I share what I’m learning, thinking about, or building 🚧.
